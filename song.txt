Roll, roll, roll on John,
Don't you roll so slow.
How can I roll when the wheels won't roll?
I asked that girl, won't you be my wife?

She fell on her knees,she began to cry.
The more she cried, the worse I felt,
'Til I thought my heart would melt.
I looked at the sun, was a-sinking low.

I looked at my baby, she was a-walkin' down the road.
I looked at the sun, was a-turning red.
I looked at my baby, but she bowed her head.
Don't the sun look lonesome, oh lord lord lord, on the graveyard fence?
